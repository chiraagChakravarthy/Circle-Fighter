# Circle-Fighter
Maybe I'll actually finish this one.
Circle fighter will be my next "large" project. It is an extremely simply concept, by which the player must shoot enemies, and can only move by rotating and accelerating. However, that's the beauty of this game; it's extremely open-ended, begging for shops, different game modes, bosses, cool backgrounds, multiplayer, the works. This is what I intended "Wave" to be, but at that point I wasn't good enough to implement all the features I wanted.
